subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. 
Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine 
the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put 
the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. 
In some cases, 
however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, 
a sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, 
or one providing background information.
Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a topic sentence.
For example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events, if a paragraph continues developing 
an idea that you introduced (with a topic sentence) in the previous paragraph, 
or if all the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer—perhaps indirectly—to a main point. 
The vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.
