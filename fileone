A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. 
Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. 
This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and 
thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
